- title: "Multi-word Expressions for Abusive Speech Detection in Serbian"
  image: mwe2020.png
  description: We pay special attention to adding Multi-word expressions that can be seen as abusive, as such lexical entries are very important in obtaining good results in a plethora of abusive language detection tasks.  We use Serbian morphological dictionaries as a basis for data cleaning and MWE dictionary creation.  A connection to otherlexical and semantic resources in Serbian is outlined and building of abusive language detection systems based on that connection is foreseen.
